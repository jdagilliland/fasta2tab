Usage: fasta2tab.py FILE [...]

Each file that you provide to fasta2tab.py should be a fasta (*.fasta) file
with a number of esoteric key-value pairs in the description.
For each file that you provide, fasta2tab.py will generate a tab delimited
values file (*.tab) which will place some of those keys in appropriate
columns, as well as compute some new keys from some of the fields provided.

Warning:
This script is as yet very esoteric, and is thus unlikely to be of great
widespread use.
