SEQUENCE: sequence
PRODUCTIVE: has no stop codon
IN_FRAME: mod(length,3) == 0
STOP: has stop codon
MUTATED_INVARIANT: call F for now
INDELS: Bochao has alignment code (no indels in current data), if it has out
    of frame gaps, then it is an indel
V_MATCH: number of nucleotides aligned until end of YYC in V gene
V_LENGTH: total length of V gene including YYC
J_MATCH: same as V except start with YW
J_LENGTH: same as V except start with YW
V_CALL: name of V gene
D_CALL: empty, do not identify D genes
J_CALL: name of J gene
SEQUENCE_GAP: redundant from SEQUENCE
V_GAP_LENGTH: length of V gene including '-' & 'N'
J_GAP_LENGTH: length of J gene including '-' & 'N'
N1_LENGTH: lenght of N/P additions before D (we cannot calculate)
N2_LENGTH: lenght of N/P additions after D (we cannot calculate)
D_5_TRIM: unk/
D_3_TRIM: unk/
J_5_TRIM: could calculate, but not necessary
JUNCTION: junction/CDR3 sequence
JUNCTION_GAP_LENGTH: length of junction region (use CDR3) (lenght of JUNCTION)
GAP_METHOD: always IMGT
*_CALL_GENOTYPE: unk/ 
CLONE_ID: should match CLONE_ID from a germline sequence
ISOTYPE: unnecessary unless provided
TISSUE: unnecessary unless provided
SUBJECT_ID: unnecessary unless provided

the CDR3 starts after the C of YYCAR and ends before the W of YW
